# Forward Swap(Pay Gas fees in Stable-coin and Meta Transaction for Uniswap trade).
# Tech: Ethereum, Polygon, Biconomy and Connext 

Forward swap is a Decentralized exchange to swap ERC20-ERC20 tokens without ETH.
You can pay gas fees in any stablecoin like DAI, USDC, USDT.
Transaction will be go through meta-transaction and user's gas fees will pay in stablecoin instead ETH. SO, user does not have to buy eth for trade.

Forward Swap App's smart contract is using Uniswap V2 smart contrat internally to swap tokens.

## Brief

Forward swap is a decentralized exchange on top of Biconomy-forward-swap and Uniswap-V2 protocols. If someone wants to exchange erc20-erc20 tokens then he needs to eth as a gas fees. forward swap solve this problem and now if you do not have eth and you want to swap token and you want to pay fees in other stablecoin token like DAI, USDC and USDT then it is possible using forward swap meta transaction. So, In summary you can swap in any other stable coin instead ETH gas fees.

## Multi-Chain Goal
In this days we only able to achieve meta transaction swap and user can pay gas fees in any stablecoin(DAI, USDT, UDSC for now). Next Goal is the to acheive on multichain. So our first prefrence we working on it is polygon(Matic). So we as a team working on Polygon using Connext network.

## What we used to build

1). Biconomy Forward Swap protocol  
2). Uniswap-V2 protocol  
3). Uniswap-Interface (open-source Frontend)  
4). Solidity  
5). React-JS  
6). EtherJS  
7). Polygon and Connext 

## Run
